# zfs kernel builder

---

## brings you the joy of built-in kernels with a single command!

More of a series of commands than a proper script, but it works

- build specified zfs package (has not been tested with <2.0)
- build specified kernel (v5.x.x only)
- compile zfs modules into kernel
- Renders zfs-initramfs, zfs-dracut packages unnecessary
- Tracks stock kernel config - should work fine!

## Kernel portion written for debian and derivatives\*

#### \*(can be modified to compile zfs rpms, but not kernels)

To run - retrieve build dependencies:
```
% chmod +x *.sh
% ./install-build-requirements.sh
```

invoke script with $ZFS_VERSION $KERNEL_VERSION and $MAKECOMMAND (optional)
Example:
```
% ./build-zfs-kernel.sh 2.0.3 5.10.17 modconfig
```

Or run without any make command - e.g.:
```
% ./build-zfs-kernel.sh 2.0.3 5.10.17
```
The above two arguments, $ZFS_VERSION and $KERNEL_VERSION are required.
